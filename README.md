# AdvancedBan
Bukkit- & BungeeCord-Plugin at once <br>
Check out our [Spigot-Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedban.8695/) for more  information!

_Coded by Leoko_ 

## This is a fork

See [original code](https://github.com/DevLeoko/AdvancedBan)  
This fork removes some annoying features completely, such as broadcasting when __Leoko__ joins the game,
Metrics and update check.

Note: I do not support this fork really, it was created for my own purposes. So you are on your own with this.  
There might be more features coming (*stares at synchronous HTTP calls*), but I can't promise them.

## Description
AdvancedBan is an All-In-One Punishment-System with warns, tempwarns, mutes, tempmutes, bans, tempbans, ipbans and kicks.
There is also a PlayerHistory so you can see the players past punishments and 
the plugin has configurable Time & Message-Layouts which automatically calculate and increase the Punishment-Time for certain reasons.
AdvancedBan provides also a full Message-File so you can change and translate all messages & a detailed config-file with a lot of useful settings.
This is a BungeeCord & Bukkit/Spigot-Plugin in one and it supports MySQL and Local-File-Storage.

## API
To use the API just add the AdvnacedBan.jar to your BuildPath and as a depency in your Plugin.yml
You can use this API in Bukkit/Spigot-Plugins but also in Bungee-Plugins.
The API-Methods can be accessed trough PuishmentManager.get()
